# D3 Challenge
CWRU Bootcamp Homework Week 16

This project involved creating dynamic graphs using the D3 JavaScript library. The data was read in from a CSV using JavaScript. The scatterplots were then created by creating a SVG canvas that contains plots graphed by the data. The plots then change on clicks created by an event watcher on the x and y axis labels. 

The data contained US Census data detailing income levels and certain risk factors like obesity, smoking, and lack of healthcare broken down by state.
